# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code

This is a repo to work through the daily toy puzzles available at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/). Note that [as requested by the AoC's creator](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e7khy8/are_everyones_input_data_and_by_extension/fa13hb9/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (_thanks Reed for the link!_), I've gitignored the input files.

### Setup

This repo uses virtualenv to manage python, so this script just helps source the right env before starting.

`sh start.sh`

### Running the problems

The template files (starting day 3) will use a `2` flag as an argument to run the second part of the puzzles.

for part1: `python 2021/day1.py`

for part2: `python 2021/day1.py 2`
